# Algorithms-Second-smallest-java

Implement the following Java method.
public static int secondSmallest(int[] arr)
This method returns the second smallest element of the input array.
Examples
(A) If input is [1, 4, 2, 3], output should be 2.
(B) If input is [3, 3, 4, 7], output should be 3. (Smallest is 3, and second smallest is 3.)
(C) If input is [9], your program will throw an exception.
